Screenshot Information:

Each group should take a screenshot of their Scrum board on at least 3 occasions during each Sprint:
1.	When the board is set up after Sprint Planning including estimation
2.	Between Tues-Thurs in the middle of the Sprint.
3.	Prior to the Sprint Demo at the end of the sprint.
These screenshots should be saved in a folder in your git repository and named: Sprint-X-NUM-Date. 
E.g. The 2nd screenshot taken in Sprint 1 would be named Sprint-1-2-29-Feb.png.
These will be used as evidence to allow us to award you grades.
